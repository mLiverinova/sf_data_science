### Project_description
The program guesses an integer from 1 to 100 in less than a 20 attempts on average out of 1000 times. The guessed number is guessed by the computer.

### What case is solving
Need to write a program that guesses a number in less than 20 attempts out of 1000 repetitions on average

### Data information
...

### Stages of the project
1. Writing a function that determines the number guessed by the computer. The method of dividing the interval of numbers in half is used, while taking into account more or less than the hidden number of the middle value of the interval.
2. Writing a function that runs the number guessing function a specified number of times and determines the average number of guesses.

### Result
Functions that satisfy the conditions of the case are obtained.

### Conclusions
The problem uses the method of dividing the interval in half. This method allows you to solve the problem with an average number of guesses 5 (out of 1000 repetitions)
